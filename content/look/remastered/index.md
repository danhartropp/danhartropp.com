title: Remastered
---
The Remastered series is about taking inspiration from the work of another artist (usually an old master) and making something new. These works owe a lot to the pieces they have been inspired by and I've tried to keep some of what made the original works great in the first place. 

The pieces all start out with some level of computer and statistical manipulation - usually to extract representative colours and then generate forms and shapes based on randomly seeded algorithms. I take the output of these computer processes and manipulate them further by adding backgrounds, arranging shapes and deleting things. 

If you're looking for something to hang on your wall that evokes the spirit of old masters but works well with modern decor, then look no further.
