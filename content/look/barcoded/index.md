title: Barcoded
---
If I'm honest, this series is really just a bit of fun. I could reference the pop art movement and its desire to emphasise the mundane, the banal and the mass-produced ... but I won't. 

Each piece in this series starts life as a working barcode for a real product. In fact most of the pieces still are working barcodes - you could take them to a shop and scan them through the till. But barcodes, while they may be brilliant (and, as it turns out, seriously complicated) they are somewhat dull to look at. So I've made them prettier, using colours taken from the packaging of the products they represent. 

If there's someone in your life who is a huge fan of baked beans or chocolate digestives (or pretty much anything else that has a barcode) then one of the works on this page might just be the perfect gift.

If there's a product you've got in mind and you can't see it here, <a href="/contact.html">get in touch</a> - there's a very good chance I'll be able to help you out.
