title: Linear Thinking
---
The pieces in this series are partly computer generated, partly man-made. 

They use the same colour palettes as the Remastered series, but their forms and shapes come from me (and my computer). They all start life as a series of randomly generated shapes that are produced by simple scripts. These shapes are duplicated, offset, rotated and shifted around by hand until I get something I'm happy with. 

Sometimes the output of the code is very close to perfect and just needs resizing on a background, other times I fiddle with them incessantly, adjusting the drawing order and the colours, tweaking the line sizes and deleting things only to add them back again a couple of hours later. 

The process is uplifting and frustrating in pretty much equal measure, but I find it compelling.
