The bottom line this week is that it's hard to fit everything in to the time available to me.

I'm arting two days a week ... this week I lost half of one of them to other paid work. It's my own fault, I knew it was going to eat into my creative time, but I find it hard to say no ... particularly as the work is well paid. I spent the remainder of that day working on my technique for painting neat rectangles/shapes. The answer (I think) is to mask the sides that are hidden under the brush, fully mask the first few and slap loads of paint on. That gives an edge to paint up to and helps keep things neat. Lots of paint also gives a nicei impasto effect, which helps differentiate between paint and print.

There's also the pressure of making things to post on Instagram. Because I'm running an experiment, I want to stay as consistent as possisble, which means posting every day. I managed to create 7 new works today, which are queued up and ready to post over the next seven days. Assuming I find time to paint next week, I'll also take some work in progress pictures to add to the pile of things I can post. But that leaves very little time for anything else ... including this website!
