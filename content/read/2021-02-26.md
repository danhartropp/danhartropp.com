This week I've managed my time better. 

There is a rhythm emerging to the way I develop my creative process, which is excellent. I can take an idea, produce 7 variations for Instagram, mull it over and iterate the idea the next week, with another 7 variations. That keeps the flow of daily posts going and means I only have to work on one idea at a time. 

So this week I'm moving into the real world and into 3D. A test collage is done, which I really like. The next step is to create one of the FTSE100 pieces in collage form ... I think in acrylic first, but it might also work having the pixels photo-printed, then collaged. 

I've also built an audio wave analyzer in place of the FTSE100 data - if I'm honest, the FTSE thing always felt a bit contrived. And I've built a video export thing - each pixel fills the frame for a period of time. It workes best (smoother transitions) at higher pixel densities than I'd want to paint!
