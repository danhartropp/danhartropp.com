I've been away from the art for a couple of weeks, but now I think I'm back. 

It had started to feel like an obligation - more about keeping the numbers up on instagram. I pulled back from making art for a while and returned to another side project ... writing professional-grade video software for live events. Which is going really well. 

Then, out of the blue, came my first sale. It felt like a much better experience than the brief foray in to shopify ... I'd invested nothing in it, I haven't even been on instagram for a couple of weeks and all of a sudden I'm not just making stuff for myself - someone out there likes what I'm doing enough to pay money for it!

The piece is printed and delivered - I can't wait to see it framed and in its new home. 

So I spent today enjoying tinkering with art stuff. I've got a new script up and running, adapting a previous vector script to photos I've taken of textures. It produces subtly complex works, but I've simplified here and there so I've got a chance of making some of them by hand. 

Which might be next week's activity.
