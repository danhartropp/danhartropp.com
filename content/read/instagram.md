Instagram is (as we all know) not just about the numbers. But, if the point of posting things to a platform is for other people to see them, then the more people that see those things the better. It follows that the more followers I have, the more people will see my things, which is a good thing.

I've just finished a week of promoting my most popular post, which looks like it might have driven quite a lot of new followers (like dozens) based on what happens in a week when I'm not promoting something, althouoghh the promoted post 'insights' suggest it only generated 9 extra followers, which at the cost of £25 really isn't worth it. I can't see an easy way of getting baseline data for how much IN engaged with other accounts during the week, so we'll use daily active time as proxy. Over the last 7 days I was on Instagram for an average of 36 minutes a day and gained 118 followers. So £25 bought me 3.27 followers per minute of engagement.

This week, I'm going to post every day and engage with people as normal - which means liking all the things I see that I like, commenting on anything I really like, or have something to say about and following back anyone who's feed I like the look of. This will act as a baseline week ... how many new followers do I pick up per minute of engagement when I'm using Instragram in a purely natural way?

Next week I'll continue normal engagement, but proactively follow a hundred accounts, which I'll find by targeting those accounts that have liked something similar to my work, and are not private.

Then I'll reduce my level of engagement for a week - does the number of new followers decrease proportionally?

In the final week, I'll reach out to some amplifier accounts and see where that takes thigns ... this is really a head-to-head with the promoted post ... does £25 spent with amplififer accounts give better results than £25 spent with Instagram?
