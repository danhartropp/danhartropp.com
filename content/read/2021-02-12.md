I spent days setting up a shopify site, but almost immediately it felt wrong and its time to move on. Don't get me wrong - it's a really impressive system and I reckon I'll be back at some point, but it doesn't work for me right now.

Almost immediately, it felt like i was setting up a high-volume, highly-optimised shopfront. It felt impersonal and a little too slick. It started to take over my thinking - I was spending too much time thinking about facebook ad ROI and discounting strategies and not enough time developing my creative practice. If I ever get to the point where I really need a streamlined ad-to-print dropshipped pipeline, then shopify will be my goto platform. But that's not right for me, right now.

So here we are, coding up another website by hand. I (mostly) enjoy this process. There's a sense of satisfaction that comes from having done it myself and an even bigger sense of satisfaction that I get to do it **exactly** my way.
